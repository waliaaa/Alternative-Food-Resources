          <h1>What Is Aquaponics?</h1>
          <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px; font-family: cursive;">According to a joint report from the Food And Agriculture Organization and SmartFish, aquaponics is the cultivation of plants and aquatic animals in a recirculating environment.

            Aquaponics is a cooperation between plants and fish and the term originates from the two words aquaculture (the growing of fish in a closed environment) and hydroponics (the growing of plants usually in a soil-less environment).
            
            Aquaponic systems come in various sizes from small indoor units to large commercial units. and they can be either freshwater systems or contain salt or brackish water.
            
            In other words, according to the Aquaponics Gardening Community, cited by Thorarinsdottir, aquaponics is the cultivation of fish and plants together in a constructed, recirculating ecosystem utilizing natural bacterial cycles to convert fish waste to plant nutrition. This is an environmentally friendly, natural food-growing method that harnesses the best attributes of aquaculture and hydroponics without the need to discard any water or filtrate or add chemical fertilizers.</p>
                
                <h1>An Aquaponics System Means Aquaculture + Hydroponics</h1>
                <h3>Understanding Aquaponics Via Aquaculture</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: cursive;">According to the National Ocean Service, as the demand for seafood has increased, technology has made it possible to grow food in coastal marine waters and the open ocean. Aquaculture is a method used to produce food and other commercial products, restore habitat and replenish wild stocks, and rebuild populations of threatened and endangered species.

                    There are two main types of aquaculture—marine and freshwater. Moreover, the FAO also describes aquaculture as the captive rearing and production of fish and other aquatic animal and plant species under controlled conditions. Many aquatic species have been cultured, especially fish, crustaceans and mollusks and aquatic plants and algae. Aquaculture production methods have been developed in various regions of the planet, and have thus been adjusted to the distinct environmental and climatic conditions in different regions. The four major categories of aquaculture include open water systems (e.g.cages, longlines), pond culture, flow-through raceways, and recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).</p>
                
                <h3>Understanding Aquaponics Via Hydroponics</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: cursive;">There are other ways of growing food rather than directly from the soil. Taking a look at a transcript from a FAO report, they speak of soil-less cultures as a way of growing agricultural crops without the use of soil. Instead of soil, various inert growing media, also called substrates, are used. These media provide plant support and moisture retention. Irrigation systems are integrated within these media, thereby introducing a nutrient solution to the plants’ root zones.

                    This solution gives all of the important nutrients for plant growth. The most common method of soil-less culture is hydroponics, which includes growing plants either on a substrate or in an aqueous medium with bare roots.</p>
                
                <h1>How Does Aquaponics Work? What’s Behind The Aquaponics Design?</h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: cursive;">Aquaponics integrates aquaculture and hydroponics into one production system. Aquaponics relies on the food introduced for fish, which works as the system’s input. As fish eat this food and process it, they transform it into urine and fecal matter, both rich in ammonia, which in sufficient quantities can be toxic to plants and fish.

                    Afterward, the water (now ammonia-rich) flows, together with un-eaten food and decaying plant matter, from the fish tank into a biofilter. Afterward, inside this biofilter, bacteria break everything down into organic nutrient solutions (nitrogen-rich) for growing vegetables.
                    
                    As we can see, aquaponics freshwater systems rely on 3 main components: freshwater aquatic animals (the fish), nitrifying bacteria, and plants – and all three living entities depend on each other to survive. Without the bacteria to consumer the fish waste, plants wouldn’t have a usable form of nutrients either – which is why biological filtration is crucial. And thanks to plant growth, nutrients are removed from the water, leaving it clean for the fish.</p>
